# **Async Queue 🚀**  

Ever needed to juggle a bunch of async tasks without things getting messy? That’s where **Async Queue** comes in! This little package helps you manage tasks one by one, handling errors and even letting you peek at what’s going on with optional debug logging. Whether you’re processing API requests, background jobs, or just want things done in order—**this queue’s got your back**.  

> 💡 **Heads up!** This project is actively maintained, and we love contributions! Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR. Just make sure everything is tested before you commit!  

> ⚠️ **Expect bugs!** If you run into anything weird, please open an issue and let us know!

## **✨ Features**  

✔️ **Easy task management** – Add tasks, process them, and grab the results when they’re done.  
✔️ **Error handling** – If something breaks, it won’t silently fail—it logs the issue!  
✔️ **Debug mode** – Want a peek under the hood? Enable debug logging to see what’s happening.  
✔️ **Fully async** – Tasks run one at a time, but everything stays non-blocking.  
✔️ **Retrieve results anytime** – No guessing games. Get task results when you need them.

## **📦 Installation**  

Just install it like any other package:  

```bash
npm install @kyvrixon/async-queue
```

## **🚀 Quick Start**  

Here’s how you can use **Async Queue** to run some tasks in order while keeping track of everything:  

```javascript
import Queue from "@kyvrixon/async-queue";

// Track when we started, so we can show how long things take
const start = Date.now();

(async () => {
    // Create a queue with debug mode ON so we can see what's happening
    const queue = new Queue('My awesome queue', true);

    // Add Task 1
    console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] [Queue] Adding Task 1`);
    await queue.add("Task 1", async () => {
        console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Task 1 - Running...`);
        console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Task 1 - Done!`);
        return 42; // Returning some random result
    });

    // Add Task 2
    console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] [Queue] Adding Task 2`);
    await queue.add("Task 2", async () => {
        console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Task 2 - Running...`);
        console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Task 2 - Done!`);
        return { foo: "bar" }; // Return an object just because we can
    });

    // Add Task 3
    console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] [Queue] Adding Task 3`);
    await queue.add("Task 3", async () => {
        console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Task 3 - Running...`);
        console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Task 3 - Done!`);
        return "Hello, world!"; // Classic result
    });

    // Get results after everything is done
    console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] [Queue] Retrieving results`);
    const result1 = await queue.getResult("Task 1");
    const result2 = await queue.getResult("Task 2");
    const result3 = await queue.getResult("Task 3");

    console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Result 1:`, result1);
    console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Result 2:`, result2);
    console.log(`[${Date.now() - start}ms] >>> Result 3:`, result3);

    // All done, let's wrap it up
    process.exit(0);
})();
```

## **🛠️ How It Works**  

- **Tasks get added to the queue** → Each task runs **one after the other** (not all at once).  
- **Results can be retrieved anytime** → No need to guess when something’s done.  
- **Debug logging helps you track execution** → You can see exactly what’s happening in real time.  

And that’s it!
